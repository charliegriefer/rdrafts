    <p>rDrafts is a third party application that lets you draft a reddit post, preview it, share it with others, save it for later, and ultimately submit it to reddit. We created rDrafts to make it easier to plan a reddit post ahead of time such as AMAs, long-form text posts, announcements by moderators, and late night inspirations.</p>
    <p>You should not use rDrafts if you do not have prior experience submitting posts to reddit. If you are new to reddit, read our <a href="http://marketersguidetoreddit.com/beginners-guide-to-reddit-for-marketers/">Beginner's Guide to reddit</a>.</p>

    <p>This application interfaces with reddit, but has no affiliation with reddit inc.</p>
