    <p>rDrafts is a third party application that lets you draft a Reddit post, preview it, share it with others, save it for later, and ultimately submit it to Reddit. We created rDrafts to make it easier to plan a Reddit post ahead of time such as AMAs, long-form text posts, announcements by moderators, and late night inspirations.</p>
    <p>You should not use rDrafts if you do not have prior experience submitting posts to Reddit. Visit <a href="http://marketersguidetoreddit.com/">our website to learn more about Reddit</a>.</p>

    <p>This application interfaces with Reddit, but has no affiliation with reddit inc.</p>
